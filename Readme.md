Spring Beans

Check the minimal dependency required for a Spring Project, Use Spring-beans

Whats inside

Tried to use spring-beans as the only dependency and do IOC. Minimal dependency required is spring-beans without which you can not do dependency injection hence i believe that is the least you need to work on a spring project. Spring-bean have transitive dependencises like

spring-core
spring-jcl

Need to check:

Create a sample app using one of the above dependency to see if we can have a spring project with just spring-core or spring-jcl .
